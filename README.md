🏦 **Bank Statement Import** — Import PDF bank statements. Upload a screenshot of any statement and GPT-4 Vision extracts the transactions automatically.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Family Sharing** — Invite family members. Everyone sees shared accounts, transactions, and gets Telegram notifications when someone logs an expense.
